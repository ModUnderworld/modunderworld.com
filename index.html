# What is Mod Underworld?

Reddit Inc. runs an event called ModWorld *(previously known as Mod Summit)*, with the ambition to bring mods together in a single day event under a select few topics and speakers with pretermined questions and answers. Some moderators in the community of r/ModSupport love the idea so much, we wanted to do an event as well, but to try an approach that Reddit Inc. can't necessarily take on its own. We're calling it, Mod *Under*world.

With mods at the helm, Reddit Mod Underworld can be focused on topics mods truly want to discuss, have proper Q&A with the audience after presentations, and host numerous sessions across many days to reduce fatigue and increase productive participation from everyone.

Join us in the first ever major community organized mod event and tell us what you want your Mod Underworld experience to be!

# Roadmap

Planning the event is being done in phases based on a general roadmap *(subject to change)*.
